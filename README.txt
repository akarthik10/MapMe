MapMe is a mobile application for Nokia Symbian S60 based handsets, which can tell your location without the assistance of GPS.
The application also enables you to track your phone in realtime, without actually using GPS.
The application is developed using Qt 4.7.3 for Nokia S60v5, and it also requires QtMobility to be installed.
The installer is unsigned, so you'll need to sign it by yourself using your certificate and key.
